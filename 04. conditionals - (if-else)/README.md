# JavaScript Conditional Statements: if, else if, else
---

## üìù Description

This JavaScript code demonstrates the fundamental **conditional statements** using `if`, `else if`, and `else` keywords. It shows how to control program flow based on different conditions.

**Specifically, this example covers:**

- Basic `if-else` statement to make a binary decision based on a condition.
- Extended `if-else if-else` statement to handle multiple conditions in sequence.
- Using comparison operators within conditional statements to evaluate expressions.

## üíª Code

```javascript
//! if-else
let weather = 'sunny';

if ( weather === 'sunny' ) {
    console.log( 'Wear sunglasses!' );
} else {
    console.log( 'Wear a raincoat!' );
}

//! if-elseif-else
let temperature = 20;

if ( temperature > 20 ) {
    console.log( 'It is warm outside!' );
} else if ( temperature < 10 ) {
    console.log( 'It is freezing outside!' );
} else if ( temperature > 30 ) {
    console.log( 'It is hot outside!' );
} else {
    console.log( 'It is a normal temperature outside!' );
}
```
